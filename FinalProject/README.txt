This is my final project and here are some notes.

* I used W3C validator in order to check my HTML and CSS and they are indeed valid.

* All the assets needed is included here and sass components are under sass directory.

* The website is believed to be fully responsive.

  - I used Google Chrome's inspector to test different device enviornments

* JQuery is used in order to help the website more responsive and for some animation.

  - Portfolio page utilizes JQuery the most in order to make the responsive grid.

* All sketches, wireframe work, and pitchboard can be found under planning directory.

* Contact Me page has no functionality yet, because I did not have time to add PHP.

  - I hope it is fine not to have the functionality because the main focus of this
    course is design aspects of the website? 

* This project is hosted at http://www.yispencer.altervista.org/ and http://cse.msu.edu/~yiseung/
