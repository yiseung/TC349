						<p>My name is Spencer Yi and I am from Okemos, Michigan. I am eagerly looking to help any business grow in the area of software development. Since childhood I have always loved creating things. Whether it be building Lego castles or handcrafting rubber band guns out of wooden chopsticks, I have always loved idea of planning, developing, and ultimately witnessing the results of my efforts. One other thing that I have learned to enjoy is fixing problems that are inevitable in the field of software development. I believe that with my abilities I will be able to bring people's ideas into an innovative reality.</p>
						<p>My desire to turn other people's ideas into reality led me to pursue a Computer Science degree at Michigan State University. Through this program I was given an amazing opportunity to boraden my knowledge of Computer Science, as well as learn various useful programming concepts such as Object Oriented PRogramming (OOP).</p>
						<p>Apart from my academic life, I gained some experience working in the International Studies Programs Office at Michigan State University throughout the summer of 2014. There I was given the tasks of maintaining web pages, adding new contents to the web pages, as well as debugging the backend software of the office's website. In having to maintain a webpage I was able to learn a lot about HTML, CSS, as well as JavaScript for the front end, PHP and MySQL for the server side. Through this position at the International Studies Programs Office I gained experience not only with the technical features, but also gained experience working with various clients. My communication skills were also improved at this job by helping many clients through different departments within the office. I would assess what they needed and quickly identify what it was they needed and then provide a solution in order to satisfy their needs.</p>
						<p>With the knowledge and skills I gained through my studies and work experience I am seeking an opportunity in the software development field, and ultimately seeking to take one step closer to my dream.</p>
