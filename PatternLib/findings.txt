I am a huge fan of images that are simple yet very powerful. For example, I like most of calligraphy designs. If I were to design a website, I think I would love to fill my website with simple calligraphy designs to grab the client's view and leave them a huge impact. I have saved some images from Dribble that I find interesting.
