	<h1>Week 5 Assignment</h1>
	<p>Choose 5 design principles from this week's lecture and find a website (or website section) that illustrates a positive and negative example of the principle.</p>
	<h2>Affordance</h2>
	<h3>eBay</h3>
	<img width="1024px" src="img/good1.png">
	<p>A good example of affordance is eBay website. Buttons are very easy to spot and easy to differentiate from other features like text boxes or forms.</p>
	<h3>Dancing Bear Toys</h3>

	http://www.dancingbeartoys.com/articles/19/about-us
	<p>I think the address bar on the right side of the screen is a bad example of an affordance because each branch's name is in white color and underlined which might look like a link that will take you to the branch's website. </p>
	<h2>Chunking</h2>
	<h3>TC 349 Website</h3>
	<img width="1024px" src="img/good3.png"><br/>
	<img width="1024px" src="img/good2.png">
	<p>Our class website is a good example for chunking contents together because each content has different background color, and that makes it easier to notice that you are looking at different contents.</p>
	<h3>Slop Swap</h3>
	<img width="1024px" src="img/bad2.png"><br/>
	http://slopswap.com/cannellini-italian-beef-stew/
	<p>I think this recipe is horrible in terms of chunking because some chunks overlap each other and gaps between chunks are not big enough.</p>
	<h2>Signal-to-Noise Ratio</h2>
	<h3>eBay</h3>
	<img width="1024px" src="img/good4.png">
	<p>eBay manages to put enough white space around what it is displaying whether it be an advertisement or actual content. Advertisements do not seem to distract users.</p>
	<h3>TigerDirect</h3>
	<img width="1024px" src="img/bad3.png">
	<p>It is clear that the CPU advertisements on the sides of website is far too distracting and it results in users losing focus on the actual products.</p>
	<h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
	<h3>Facebook</h3>
	<img width="1024px" src="img/good5.png">
	<p>Facebook uses three rows to display different menus. One for groups, one for newsfeed, and another for chat. With newsfeed being the main row, it is in the middle which is the main point of the grid. Facebook utilized the grid pretty well.</p>
	<h3>Slop Swap</h3>
	<img width="1024px" src="img/bad2.png">
	<p>This website does not seem to follow the grids at all. All chunks are all over the place, they overlap, no gaps between chunks, and so much more.</p>
	<h2>Hick's Law</h2>
	<h3>Google</h3>
	<img width="1024px" src="img/good6.png">
	<p>Google simplifies the menus and puts almost nothing on the page. The page looks really simple and other items from the menu is under the "more" icon, so that is really neat.</p>
	<h3>MSUFCU</h3>
	<img width="1024px" src="img/bad4.png">
	<p>This website puts too much information on one page. There is a menu on the top for locations, ATMs, Careers, and etc. There is another menu under the MSU logo, which is pretty redundant. This website seems to put 3~4 different menus which in my opinion is unnecessary.</p>
